# Grad-school-projects
These are all of the projects I created while in grad school. Below is an index to the course numbers and content.

MATH 6101: Uncertainty Quantification -- This was a class that taught numerical and computational methods for updating linear models to create probability distributions and statistics for underlying processes such as random fields or when modeling the error structure.

MASTH 6388: Advanced Statstical Research Methods -- This was a statistical and machine learning class. This including paramtetric and non-parametric prediction methods, data visualization, methods for model selection, and neural networks.
